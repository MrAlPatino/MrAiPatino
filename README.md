A basic discord bot made by me lol
This bot will provide basic tasks such as moderation, fun commands (just random commands but whatever)
All in python (im too lazy to do it in java or c++)
dne eht (read it in reverse)

use "pip install -r requirements.txt" on cmd prompt on the folder were main.py is and it will install the modules required, then just run main.py
